# Fish-Species-Classification-using-Deep-Learning-PyTorch-
This project is a Multiclass Fish Image Classifier built using PyTorch.   It identifies different fish species from images using deep learning and transfer learning models like CNN, VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet.   The best-performing model (VGG16) is deployed using Streamlit for real-time predictions.
